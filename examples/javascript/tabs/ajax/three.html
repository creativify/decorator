	The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental 
	organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing 
	countries. It was established in the United Kingdom in 1919 in order to improve the lives 
	of children through better education, health care, and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency 
	aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts.
	In addition to the UK organisation, there are 30 other national Save the Children organisations 
	who are members of Save the Children International, a global network of nonprofit organisations s
	upporting local partners in over 120 countries around the world.
	Save the Children promotes policy changes in order to gain more rights for young people 
	especially by enforcing the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Alliance members 
	coordinate emergency-relief efforts, helping to protect children from the effects of war and violence. 
	Save the Children has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
