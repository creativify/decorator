	With the general lack of roads, electricity, schools, hospitals and health clinics, 
	as well as a lack of potable water and sanitation services, we helped Mpilonhle embark on 
	a more holistic approach to address the broader needs of the community in ways which enhanced their HIV prevention work.
	In early 2011, construction began on a collaborative community initiative called Home Field Advantage (
	HFA) to bring clean water sources, sports fields, food gardens, community laundry basins, and 
	non-contaminating toilet blocks to four secondary schools.
	The generosity of CTAOPâ€™s supporters, including the Annenberg Foundation, ONEXONE, 
	Orange County Center for Living Peace, Red Granite Pictures and many others, enabled 
	Mpilonhle to create hubs of activity at these schools that will allow their health services 
	to reach beyond enrolled students to the community at large.
