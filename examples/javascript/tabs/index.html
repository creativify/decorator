            With the general lack of roads, electricity, schools, hospitals and health clinics, 
            as well as a lack of potable water and sanitation services, we helped Mpilonhle embark on 
            a more holistic approach to address the broader needs of the community in ways which enhanced their HIV prevention work.
            In early 2011, construction began on a collaborative community initiative called Home Field Advantage (
            HFA) to bring clean water sources, sports fields, food gardens, community laundry basins, and 
            non-contaminating toilet blocks to four secondary schools.
            The generosity of CTAOP’s supporters, including the Annenberg Foundation, ONEXONE, 
            Orange County Center for Living Peace, Red Granite Pictures and many others, enabled 
            Mpilonhle to create hubs of activity at these schools that will allow their health services 
            to reach beyond enrolled students to the community at large.

            The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental 
            organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing 
            countries. It was established in the United Kingdom in 1919 in order to improve the lives 
            of children through better education, health care, and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency 
            aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts.
            In addition to the UK organisation, there are 30 other national Save the Children organisations 
            who are members of Save the Children International, a global network of nonprofit organisations s
            upporting local partners in over 120 countries around the world.
            Save the Children promotes policy changes in order to gain more rights for young people 
            especially by enforcing the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Alliance members 
            coordinate emergency-relief efforts, helping to protect children from the effects of war and violence. 
            Save the Children has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

            <span>Acute hunger or starvation are often highlighted on TV screens: hungry mothers too 
                weak to breastfeed their children in drought-hit Ethiopia, refugees in war-torn Syria queueing for food rations, 
                helicopters airlifting high energy biscuits to earthquake victims in Haiti or Pakistan.</span>
            <br>
            These situations are the result of high profile crises like war or natural disasters, 
            which starve a population of food. Yet emergencies account for less than eight percent 
            of hunger's victims. Daily undernourishment is a less visible form of hunger -- but it 
            affects many more people, from the shanty towns of Jakarta in Indonesia and the Cambodian 
            capital Phnom Penh to the mountain villages of Bolivia and Nepal. In these places, hunger 
            is much more than an empty stomach. For weeks, even months, its victims must live on significantly 
            less than the recommended 2,100 kilocalories that the average person needs to lead a healthy life. 
            The body compensates for the lack of energy by slowing down its physical and mental activities. 
            A hungry mind cannot concentrate, a hungry body does not take initiative, a hungry child loses all 
            desire to play and study. Hunger also weakens the immune system. Deprived of the right nutrition, 
            hungry children are especially vulnerable and become too weak to fight off disease and may die from common 
            infections like measles and diarrhoea. Each year, almost 7 million children die before reaching the age of five; 
            malnutrition is a key factor in over a third of these deaths. <a href="http://www.wfp.org" target="_blank">Visit Us</a>
